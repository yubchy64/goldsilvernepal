Goal: Return HTML responses as markdown when agents request it

Issue: Site does not support Markdown for Agents

Fix: Enable Markdown for Agents so requests with Accept: text/markdown return a markdown version of your HTML response while HTML stays the default for browsers. Confirm the response uses Content-Type: text/markdown (and x-markdown-tokens if available).

Goal: Declare AI content usage preferences with Content Signals in robots.txt

Issue: No Content Signals found in robots.txt

Content-Signal: ai-train=no, search=yes, ai-input=no

Goal: Publish an API catalog for automated API discovery (RFC 9727)

Issue: API Catalog not found

Fix: Create /.well-known/api-catalog returning application/linkset+json with a "linkset" array. Each entry should include an "anchor" URL for the API and link relations for service-desc (OpenAPI spec), service-doc (documentation), and status (health endpoint). See RFC 9727 Appendix A for examples.

Goal: Publish OAuth/OIDC discovery metadata so agents can authenticate with your APIs

Issue: No OAuth/OIDC discovery metadata found

Fix: If your site has protected APIs, publish /.well-known/openid-configuration (for OpenID Connect) or /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server (for pure OAuth 2.0) with your issuer, authorization_endpoint, token_endpoint, jwks_uri, and grant_types_supported. This allows AI agents to programmatically discover how to authenticate.

Goal: Publish OAuth Protected Resource Metadata so agents can discover how to authenticate

Issue: No OAuth Protected Resource Metadata found

Fix: Publish /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource with your resource identifier, authorization_servers (list of OAuth/OIDC issuer URLs that can issue tokens for this resource), and scopes_supported. This tells agents how to obtain access tokens for your protected APIs.

Goal: Publish an MCP Server Card for agent discovery

Issue: MCP Server Card not found

Fix: Serve an MCP Server Card (SEP-1649) at /.well-known/mcp/server-card.json with serverInfo (name, version), transport endpoint, and capabilities. The schema is being standardized at https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/modelcontextprotocol/pull/2127

Goal: Publish an agent skills discovery index

Issue: Agent Skills index not found

Fix: Publish a skills discovery index at /.well-known/agent-skills/index.json (per the Agent Skills Discovery RFC v0.2.0). Include a $schema field, and a skills array where each entry has name, type, description, url, and a sha256 digest.

Goal: Support WebMCP to expose site tools to AI agents via the browser

Issue: No WebMCP tools detected on page load

Fix: Implement the WebMCP API by calling navigator.modelContext.provideContext() with tool definitions that expose your site's key actions to AI agents. Each tool needs a name, description, inputSchema (JSON Schema), and an execute callback function.
